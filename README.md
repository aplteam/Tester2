# Tester2: a Test Framework for Unit Tests in Dyalog APL

`Tester2` gives you everything you need for building test cases in complex scenarios:

* Automatic execution of tests by naming convention

* You can organize your tests in groups if you wish

* You may execute all tests, or one or more groups, or one or more particular tests

* You can control the flow with helper function so that falinig tests either carry on and report the failing or stop on the spot, allowing investigation

* You can make an INI file part of the tests, for exampel for machine-dependent parameters

*
